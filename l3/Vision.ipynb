    "## Using the Computer Vision API\n",
    "The techniques used so far in this notebook show how you can perform simple image amnipulation and apply some popular algorithms to analyze images. More complex image analysis capabilities are encapsulated in the Computer Vision API cognitive service.\n",

    "### Create a Computer Vision API Service\n",
    "To provision a Computer Vision API service in your Azure subscription, Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open another browser tab and navigate to https://portal.azure.com.\n",
    "2. Sign in using your Microsoft account.\n",
    "3. Click **+ New**, and in the **AI + Cognitive Services** category, click **See all**.\n",
    "4. In the list of cognitive services, click **Computer Vision API**.\n",
    "5. In the **Computer Vision API** blade, click **Create**.\n",
    "6. In the **Create** blade, enter the following details, and then click **Create**\n",
    "  * **Name**: A unique name for your service.\n",
    "  * **Subscription**: Your Azure subscription.\n",
    "  * **Location**: Choose the Azure datacenter location where you want to host your service.\n",
    "  * **Pricing tier**: Choose the F0 pricing tier.\n",
    "  * **Resource Group**: Choose the existing resource group you created in the previous lab (or create a new one if you didn't complete the previous lab)\n",
    "  * Read the notice about the use of your data, and select the checkbox.\n",
    "7. Wait for the service to be created.\n",
    "8. When deployment is complete, click **All Resources** and then click your Computer Vision service to open its blade.\n",
    "9. In the blade for your Computer Vision service, note the **Endpoint** URL. Then assign the base URI (*location*.api.cognitive.microsoft.com) for your service to the **visionURI** variable in the cell below.\n",
    "10. In the blade for your Computer Vision service, click **Keys** and then copy **Key 1** to the clipboard and paste it into the **visionKey** variable assignment value in the cell below. \n",
    "11. Run the cell below to assign the variables.\n"
